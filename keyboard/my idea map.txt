1. Key Traversal Mechanism
Key Traversal: Implement a system that cycles through keys on the keyboard. You could use a visual highlight or an animation to indicate the currently selected key.
Remote Click Detection: Detect clicks from the remote control to perform actions:
Single Click: Print the letter of the currently selected key.
Double Click: Move to the next key or area.
2. Inactivity Detection and Alerts
Inactivity Timer: Set a timer that triggers after 3 seconds of inactivity. When the timer expires, display an alert prompt.
Alert Prompt:
Options:
Double Click: Move to the next text area.
Single Click: Show more options.
3. Additional Options Prompt
Secondary Prompt: If the user single-clicks in the first prompt, display another prompt with:

Double Click: Send the message.
Single Click: Go back to the previous options.
Timeout Handling: Cancel the secondary prompt and return to the first key after 5 seconds of inactivity.

4. Message Sending and Resetting
Send Message: When the user selects the “Send” option (double click in the secondary prompt), send the message and stop key traversal.
Reset: After sending the message, wait for the user to click the remote again to start key traversal from the first key.
5. Implementation Steps
Key Traversal Logic:

Create a loop or sequence to highlight keys one by one.
Use a visual cue (e.g., a border or background color change) to indicate the selected key.
Remote Control Handling:

Implement event listeners for single and double clicks from the remote.
Use these events to perform actions (print letter, move to next key, etc.).
Inactivity Timer:

Use JavaScript's setTimeout to handle inactivity.
Trigger the alert prompt if no activity is detected for 3 seconds.
Reset the timer on each remote click.
Prompt Handling:

Display the alert prompt with options.
Use additional timers for handling secondary prompts and timeouts.
Message Sending:

Implement the logic to send the message when selected.
Reset the keyboard interface for new input after sending.
